- Structured logging with different log levels
- Safe handling of circular references in objects
- Detailed error tracing with context
- Stream chunk formatting and tracking

This is a **critical enhancement** that improves:
- Debugging capability
- Error recovery
- System observability

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

Several UI enhancements were made:
- New activity bar icon implemented (⟡ symbol)
- Welcome view improvements with better error handling
- Package icon conversion to PNG format

### 3. Stream Error Handling

Significant improvements to streaming error recovery:
- Automatic UI recovery during streaming errors
- Proper error message display to users
- Better error context preservation
- WebSocket error handling with user feedback

### 4. Build Stability

Build system improvements:
- Package dependencies minimization
- Build process stabilization 
- Added typescript-eslint dependency

### 5. LLM Models

Changes related to LLM models (marked as obsolete):
- Defined internal test models in the LLMModel enum
- Default model changes in modelManager.ts
- Model naming and string values updates

## Missing Patches & Issues

Based on the analysis, the following functionality may have been lost or reverted:

1. **Critical Error Handling in LLMService**
   - The `LogUtil` class and improved error handling in `llmService.ts` may have been reverted
   - This affects the stability of the streaming functionality

2. **WebSocket Streaming Improvements**
   - Enhanced WebSocket streaming support with better error recovery
   - User feedback during stream errors
   - Proper stream cancellation handling

3. **UI Refinements**
   - Activity bar icon update
   - Welcome view improvements

   - Reimplement the `LogUtil` class in `llmService.ts` without internal network references
   - Maintain error handling improvements for streaming

2. **Fix Streaming Error Recovery**
   - Restore the proper error handling code in streaming functions
   - Ensure UI recovery when errors occur
   - Implement proper error message display

3. **Restore UI Improvements**
